There is 3 files, well, now 4, because I script all the examples to test them
So then, this was because I saw a tutorial and got support from a forum, so
due to my little knowledge of JS (But I'll still learning tho)
they recommended me to do this with other file and make the script of
the functions, and then test it on the terminal, but I'm afraid to be wrong

But anyways, this one was hard in my opinion, but it's ok.
If I learn things like this, it's an achievement in my opinion, thanks.
